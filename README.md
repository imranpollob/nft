# NFT Rental Marketplace

A comprehensive Ethereum-based NFT rental marketplace built with Solidity and Foundry. This platform enables NFT owners to list their assets for time-based rentals while providing renters with temporary access to exclusive digital assets.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Rental System
- **Time-based Rentals**: Rent NFTs for specific durations with precise start/end times
- **Conflict Prevention**: Advanced overlap detection prevents double-booking
- **Secure Escrow**: Funds are held safely until rental completion
- **Protocol Fees**: Configurable fee structure with automatic distribution

### Advanced Security
- **Transfer Protection**: Prevents unauthorized transfers during active rentals
- **Role-based Access**: Marketplace-controlled user assignment for rentals
- **Reentrancy Guards**: Protection against common smart contract vulnerabilities
- **Ownership Validation**: Race condition prevention for listing changes

### Subscription System
- **ERC-1155 Membership Passes**: Time-boxed subscriptions for premium services
- **Multiple Tiers**: Flexible tier system with independent expiry tracking
- **Soulbound Options**: Optional transfer restrictions per subscription tier
- **Renewal Logic**: Seamless extension of active memberships

### Royalty Support
- **ERC-2981 Compatible**: Standard royalty implementation for secondary sales
- **Configurable Rates**: Default 5% royalty to original creators
