### üöÄ Quick Development Setup

For a **new computer** or **fresh environment**, run the automated setup script:

```bash
# This will start Anvil, deploy all contracts, and configure the frontend
./setup-dev.sh
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Check all dependencies (Foundry, Node.js, npm)
- ‚úÖ Start Anvil local Ethereum node
- ‚úÖ Deploy all smart contracts
- ‚úÖ Auto-generate `.env.local` with deployed addresses
- ‚úÖ Install frontend dependencies
- ‚úÖ Test the build

### üîÑ Redeploy Contracts

If you already have the environment set up and just want to redeploy contracts:

```bash
# Make sure Anvil is running
anvil

# In another terminal, redeploy contracts
./redeploy.sh
```

### üì¶ NPM Scripts

The project includes convenient npm scripts for common tasks:

```bash
npm run setup        # Run the full development setup
npm run redeploy     # Redeploy contracts only
npm run test         # Run smart contract tests
npm run build        # Build smart contracts
npm run frontend:dev # Start frontend development server
npm run frontend:build # Build frontend for production
npm run frontend:install # Install frontend dependencies
```


## üß™ Testing

### Smart Contracts
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
forge test
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for cross-contract interactions
- Rental conflict prevention
- Transfer safety mechanisms
- Subscription renewal logic
- Royalty calculations
- Access control validation

### Frontend Application
Run the development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## üìñ Usage

### Local Development

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
./setup-dev.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
Start a local Ethereum node:
```bash
anvil
```

Deploy contracts and update environment:
```bash
./redeploy.sh
```

Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Environment Configuration

The deployment scripts automatically create/update `frontend/.env.local` with deployed contract addresses. For full functionality, add these additional variables:

```bash
# WalletConnect Project ID (get from https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

# Default chain (base or polygon)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_CHAIN=base

# RPC URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com

# Contract Addresses (Auto-generated by deployment script)
